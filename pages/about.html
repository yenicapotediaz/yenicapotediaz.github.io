      <h2>Well, hello stranger!</h2>
      <p>Let me talk about myself for a moment. As you might not know, I haven't always been a software engineer. My former career was in child development, i.e. I used to be a nanny not too long ago! I found myself interested in programming while taking a couple courses at an online university. I found myself enrolling online full-time while also working full-time as a nanny. While I loved the courses I just couldn't keep doing them while working for too long. That was when I came across Ada Developer's Academy. I strongly related to their mission in helping women and gender-diverse people enter the tech industry and be ready for a job in 11 months! What would have taken me years to achieve via online classes while working could be done at Ada in less than a year. I was ecstatic, and just what I was looking for. Ada wasn't your typical bootcamp that tosses you out after a few weeks of curriculum. At Ada I found an amazing community of smart, driven, and wonderful individuals looking for a career change. My experience at Ada inspired me to be more active in the community, becoming a mentor, and ultimately take advantage of the opportunity to bring more exposure to the lack of diversity in tech. As a woman of color in this industry, I can tell you first-hand how important diversity, inclusion and a strong community is crucial for the success of people entering the industry is. Actually, I have given talks on this very topic!</p>
      <p>Ada provided me with a 5-month internship with a sponsoring company. I had the opportunity to intern at Samsung SDS. While Ada's curriculum is focused on web development, Samsung was definitely not that. I started working with Kubernetes, something I didn't even know existed a few weeks prior, and within a month I was contributing to their open source tooling which help deploy a high-availability Kuberntes cluster on AWS or GKE. It was both exciting and terrifying to be learning something completely different. My experience at Samsung has allowed me to sharpen my "always learning" skills. One of my favorite things about this industry is always being new at something despite your experience in tech. I am constantly learning, failing, learning from it, and always growing. </p>
      <p>While I enjoy what I do at work, I like to kick back and try to do other things besides being glued to my computer. I currently reside in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and love going on long solo hikes with my dog. I also enjoy photography and have plenty of mountain summit selfies and panoramas. Even though I have a dog, I am a cat person at heart. My three cats rule the house and keep the dog in check. When I am not exploring the woods, I like to create things. It doesn't always go well because trying to replicate what I find on Pinterest is sometimes dissapointing.  </p>
